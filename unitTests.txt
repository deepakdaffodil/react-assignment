Q) What technologies do you use to unit test your react components?
A)  We use Jest and Enzyme to unit test our react components where
    -> Jest provides a test runner, assertion library, and mocking library.
    -> Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert,
       manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output.

Q) Are there any pitfalls associated with this technology that have caused you difficulty
   in the past?
A)  Yes, I found it difficult to test asynchronous processes and we can not test react portals
    using the same.

Q) How do you test in your unit tests to see if the correct properties are being passed to child components.
A)  We usually set state and props for the component we going to test and then we use enzyme utils
    (shallow or full dom render apis) to check whether expected elements on dom and rendered or not.
